# ATMsystem
Assignment 3 SYSC4001

Make a system Database interface that is multi-threaded.

The Run method for the ATM server and editor is to compile the .cpp with -pthread compile include.

The DBeditor will run first, then the same main method starts the DBServer and the ATM client.

This was done to avoid complicated output windows, while the multi threading is demonstrated with the second two pthreads running the code.
